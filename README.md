# 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This repository demonstrates an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a P2P Lending Platform based on blockchain technology. It is developed as a part of the FinTech courses in Erasmus University Rotterdam - School of Management. The course highlights the importance of applying modern techniques to improve challenges in the finance sectors. Overall, this MVP uses the following tools: 

Key Tools Utilized:

**Truffle and Ganache:** These are Node.js-based tools used for simulating the Ethereum blockchain environment. They facilitate smart contract development, testing, and deployment without incurring actual blockchain costs.

**Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework utilized to render a local HTML user interface. Flask handles backend operations and serves as the intermediary between the frontend UI and blockchain interactions.

**Web3:** Used in the backend to establish interactions between the Flask-powered backend and the Ethereum blockchain. Web3 enables transaction execution, smart contract interactions, and data retrieval.

The project aims to showcase the feasibility and functionality of a blockchain-powered P2P lending platform. It emphasizes practical implementation and demonstration of blockchain technology's potential in financial applications, focusing on security, transparency, and efficiency enhancements.
